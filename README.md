This repository contains the decompiled contents of the SynthGPT.ver.1.1.0.build.2.apks file. The original file was an APKS bundle containing the following APKs:

* base.apk
* split_config.arm64_v8a.apk
* split_config.en.apk
* split_config.xxhdpi.apk

Each APK has been decompiled into its own directory. To reassemble an APK, zip the contents of its corresponding directory.

To reassemble the APKS file, the individual APKs must be reassembled first. Then, the reassembled APKs, along with the `icon.png` file, should be zipped together to create the final APKS file.
